Conducted an AI-driven analysis to predict VPN safety by detecting IP and DNS leaks, assessing encryption strength, and identifying anomalies in VPN behavior. Compared the performance of LSTM and GRU models using key evaluation metrics to recommend the most effective technique for securing VPN connections.
Technologies Used: Python, LSTM, GRU
